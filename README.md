# BrainSaver
BrainSaver is a toy language that compiles to [BrainFuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).
The compiler code is written in Kotlin and uses the [ANTLR4 parser generator](http://www.antlr.org/).
Inspiration is drawn from
[BrainFix](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/558979/BrainFix-the-language-that-translates-to-fluent-Br) and the
[esolang wiki](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck_algorithms).
